# Movies

Android Application that use MOVIE API: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

it enables user to view popular movies view its details also you can add any movie to favourite list.

also I use room db to cache the APIs response to handle no internet connection.

NOTE
I know i should create token dynamically but I didn`t get up to this endpoint so I used it as a static.

If you need to try application here is the APK: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MB9ucmTolmVP7-lofMrCJ4AEUvul6IWn/view?usp=sharing
